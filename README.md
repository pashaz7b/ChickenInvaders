Chicken Invaders Game
This is a classic arcade-style game where you play as a spaceship pilot who must defend the Earth from an invasion of chicken invaders. The game is built using Processing in Java.

Getting Started
To run the game, you will need to have Processing installed on your computer. You can download Processing here.

Once you have Processing installed, you can download or clone this repository to your local machine. Open the ChickenInvaders.pde file in Processing and click the "Run" button to start the game.

How to Play
Use the mouse to move your spaceship left and right, and use the space bar to shoot at the chickens. As you progress through the levels, the chickens will become faster and more difficult to defeat. Be careful not to let them get too close to your spaceship or you will lose a life.

Customization
You can customize various aspects of the game by editing the variables at the top of the ChickenInvaders.pde file. For example, you can change the starting number of lives, the speed of the chickens, and the background music.
